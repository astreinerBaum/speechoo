The LaPSAPI project is a project for Eclipse C++ IDE, you can just import it into your workspace (it is important to see that you need the julius folder).

Once you have imported the project you can just compile it. LaPSAPI is a project of a Shared Library to control Julius.

The TestLaPSAPI folder has another Eclipse Project that test the developed API. To test it you need an Acoustic Model and a Grammar, here you can use the LaPS models.

To run you have to copy the shared library to one of your library folders (/usr/lib, /lib, ...), or just set the variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the path that contains the compiled LaPSAPI that is LaPSAPI.so.
