= Introduction =

Manual to build the Coruja package in Linux systems.


= Julius =

Inside the folder LaPSAPI, you have a folder called julius-4.1.4. Build it executing:

./configure
make

*PATCH:* had to modify Makefile.in libjulius and libsent to include -fPIC to the CPPFLAGS. _Should investigate how to avoid it_.

Verify if Julius was correctly built. Open julius-4.1.4/julius and try ./julius

= Eclipse Project =

The LaPSAPI is a project for Eclipse C++ IDE, you can just import it into your workspace (it is important to see that you need the julius folder).

Once you have imported the project you can just compile it. LaPSAPI is a project of a Shared Library to control Julius.


= Teste Project =

The TestLaPSAPI folder has another Eclipse Project that test the developed API. To test it you need an Acoustic Model and a Grammar, here you can use the LaPS models.

To run you have to copy the shared library to one of your library folders (/usr/lib, /lib, ...), or just set the variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the path that contains the compiled LaPSAPI that is LaPSAPI.so.
