Preparing the work environment

= Introduction =

Steps to prepare the work environment, to build and develop.

= Software required =

* To build you need Maven: http://maven.apache.org/download.html

* NetBeans IDE 6.8 (distribuição Java SE): http://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html

* OpenOffice.org 3.2.0 Software Development Kit (SDK): http://download.openoffice.org/sdk/index.html

* Plug-in Ooo Netbeans (available in NetBeans plugin management)

* BrOffice.org 3.2.0: http://broffice.org/download

* If the .OXT generated by Maven is not working, try building it from NetBeans.

_Note:_ the example code uses Boost Thread. To install it under Ubuntu do: "sudo apt-get install libboost-thread-dev". For other OS check Boost web page: www.boost.org (we probably will not need it after Coruja integration).


= Try JNI without OOo extension =

CorujaJNI class has an main method that invokes native methods. You can use it if only testing the Java C++ bind.
